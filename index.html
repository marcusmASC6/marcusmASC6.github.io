            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>Hi, my name is Marcus Jabari Moise, and this is my website. I am currently an 11th grader at Elisabeth Irwin Highschool, also known as LREI. I designed this website to be an interactive experience in which you can feel free to learn about my backstory and look through some of my other projects. If you are here for job recruitment, I would like to inform you that this website will also act partially as my resume. I have job experience as a volunteer at Laurence Nursing Home where I worked for the entirety of the summer. I also acted as a volunteer organizer in a non-for-profit organization called Rockaway Youth Task Force. I am an active member of my school’s Feminism Club, Students of Color Club, and a Co-Leader of the Black Student Union.

        <h3>I was born April 12th, 2003 in a Manhattan hospital. My mom said that as a baby, I quickly discovered the mechanics of my stroller seatbelt and would repeatedly disconnect it. Ever since I was able to speak and read, my mother had been homeschooling me as she took off from work for 3 years. She transformed the house into a learning center where times tables and periodic tables were on the walls and I was provided with a desk and my own bookshelf. When I reached the age of 4 I was admitted into Goldie Maple Academy's Pre-K. It was there that my mother was first introduced into the term "Gifted and Talented". After discovering that her old teacher had become the principle of her own school, my mom decided to admit me into P.S.232. It was there that I was introduced to scholarship programs such as <strong>Prep for Prep</strong> and <strong>A Better Chance</strong>. After multiple applications, I was admitted to A Better Chance in 5th grade and left my school for LREI's middle school, also known as Little Red. While in Little Red, I traveled on school trips to Virginia, Washington, and Spain, and continue to push myself academically in hopes of pursuing a college scholarship.</h3>
